# 🧠 Stroke Risk Prediction System

This project presents an AI-powered stroke risk prediction tool that combines **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** models to assess a person's likelihood of experiencing a stroke based on health data. It is designed to enable **early diagnosis** and promote **preventive care**, especially in **rural or underserved regions**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Dual-model pipeline:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN, and LSTM for robust performance.
- **Imbalanced data handling:** Uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to improve detection of minority stroke cases.
- **Custom thresholding:** Tuned decision threshold (e.g., 0.4) to reduce false negatives—critical in medical applications.
- **Explainability:** Includes SHAP-based feature importance for transparent predictions.
- **Scalability:** Lightweight and can be deployed in mobile or cloud-based environments for real-time prediction.

## 📊 Dataset Features
The system uses medical parameters such as:
- Age, Hypertension, Heart Disease
- Glucose Levels, BMI, Gender, Smoking Status, and more.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SHAP
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Google Colab

## 📈 Results
The models demonstrated strong performance:
- **Accuracy:** ~94%
- **F1 Score & ROC AUC:** High scores across the board
- Balanced performance for both stroke and non-stroke classes.

## 🧪 Architecture & Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **SMOTE Oversampling**
3. **Model Training (ML + DL)**
4. **Threshold Tuning**
5. **Evaluation & Explainability**
6. **Real-time Prediction Ready**
